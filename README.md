<!-- Describe this theme/component in one or two sentences -->

A clean & modern theme with a handful of theme-components included to enhance our custom forum!

This theme includes a handful of components to enhance your forum as well.
- Dark Light Scheme Toggle
- Clickable Topics
- Discourse Loading Slider
- Discourse Search Banner
- Modern Category + Group Boxes

This theme component also allows the forum admin to organize their category page with header titles, and choose which categories appear under each header. To keep things simple, I have only allowed up to 5 headings to be used. **If no categories + heading settings are chosen, all categories will render as they do above, this is the default rendering option.**

I hope you enjoy!
